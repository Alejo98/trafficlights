\section {Conclusion}

Based on our results, the ``ultimate'' set-up is
(which algorithm?)
discount factor of 0.95
$\epsilon$-greedy with $\epsilon$ discounted over time at the rate of 0.99 99 99 9
OcupancyState3 representation
Learning rate of 0.05

This set-up will provide the best performance in the long-haul, which is
suitable for traffic light control since most traffic lights stay there
for a very long time. However, a much more cost effective
option is to build a roundabout, which saves electricity, saves maintenance
costs, saves having to write software to control traffic lights.
