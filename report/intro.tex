\section {Introduction}

Reinforcement learning is naturally suited to control problems
since it readily fits the idea of agent and its environment and
in particular, learning on the job. Unlike classification algorithms,
it is not necessary to have a training set available. In this assignment,
we look at the problem of an agent controlling a traffic light with
three signals (red, amber, green) at a four roads (north-south,
south-north, east-west, and west-east) intersection. We implement various algorithms
and state representation, and compare their performance using
various parameters.
