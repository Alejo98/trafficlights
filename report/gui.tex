\section{Quick Tour of the GUI}

To start the GUI, run \verb/java -cp <project JAR file> tf.gui.App/.
Type in the desired traffic intensity setting in the 2nd text box
near the bottom of the GUI, then click on the menu item
\textbf{File} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Set Simulation Class}. Pick the simulation
algorithm you want to test,
then click \textbf{OK} button and a new traffic model will be
initialised with a default random number seed. This way we can
pick different algorithms and test them using the same random
number seed so as to be consistent.

Set the Step Duration (1st text box near bottom of GUI) to 100
if you want to see the traffic animating, or set it to 0 if
you want the result as soon as possible. With a timestep
duration near 0, the GUI will ``skip frames'' to keep up with
the traffic model changes.

Click the \textbf{File} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Start Simulation} menu item
and enter the number of timesteps to simulate continuously. Anything
more than 1000 will take a few minutes. Then click \textbf{OK}
button and watch the simulation take place. For debugging,
we use the \textbf{Next Step} button, which simulate 1 timestep
per click. For experimentation, the GUI is too slow and not
required, so we run experiments via the command line using
the \verb/tf.api.experiment.Main/ class.
